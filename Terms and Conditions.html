<h2 _ngcontent-c19="">Basis of Sale</h2>

<ol _ngcontent-c19="" class="clauses">
	<li _ngcontent-c19="">The description of the Goods in our website does not constitute a contractual offer to sell the Goods. When an Order has been submitted on the Website, we can reject it for any reason, although we will try to tell you the reason without delay.</li>

	<li _ngcontent-c19="">No variation of the Contract, whether about description of the Goods, Fees or otherwise, can be made after it has been entered into unless the variation is agreed by the Customer and the Supplier in writing.</li>
	<li _ngcontent-c19="">We intend that these Terms and Conditions apply only to a Contract entered into by you as a Consumer. If this is not the case, you must tell us, so that we can provide you with a different contract with terms which are more appropriate for you and which might, in some respects, be better for you, eg by giving you rights as a business.</li>
</ol>

<h2 _ngcontent-c19="">Price and Payment</h2>

<ol _ngcontent-c19="" class="clauses">
	<li _ngcontent-c19="">The price of the Goods and any additional delivery or other charges is that set out on the Website at the date of the Order or such other price as we may agree in writing.</li>

	<li _ngcontent-c19="">In any case, regardless of events beyond our control, if we do not deliver the Goods on time, you can (in addition to any other remedies) treat the Contract at an end if:
	<ol _ngcontent-c19="">
		<li _ngcontent-c19="">we have refused to deliver the Goods, or if delivery on time is essential taking into account all the relevant circumstances at the time the Contract was made, or you said to us before the Contract was made that delivery on time was essential; or</li>
		<li _ngcontent-c19="">after we have failed to deliver on time, you have specified a later period which is appropriate to the circumstances and we have not delivered within that period.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li _ngcontent-c19="">If you treat the Contract at an end, we will (in addition to other remedies) promptly return all payments made under the Contract.</li>
	<li _ngcontent-c19="">If you were entitled to treat the Contract at an end, but do not do so, you are not prevented from cancelling the Order for any Goods or rejecting Goods that have been delivered and, if you do this, we will (in addition to other remedies) without delay return all payments made under the Contract for any such cancelled or rejected Goods. If the Goods have been delivered, you must return them to us or allow us to collect them from you and we will pay the costs of this.</li>
	<li _ngcontent-c19="">If any Goods form a commercial unit (a unit is a commercial unit if division of the unit would materially impair the value of the goods or the character of the unit) you cannot cancel or reject the Order for some of those Goods without also cancelling or rejecting the Order for the rest of them.</li>
	<li _ngcontent-c19="">We do not generally deliver to addresses outside England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and Channels Islands. If, however, we accept an Order for delivery outside that area, you may need to pay import duties or other taxes, as we will not pay them.</li>
	<li _ngcontent-c19="">You agree we may deliver the Goods in instalments if we suffer a shortage of stock or other genuine and fair reason, subject to the above provisions and provided you are not liable for extra charges.</li>
	<li _ngcontent-c19="">If you or your nominee fail, through no fault of ours, to take delivery of the Goods at the Delivery Location, we may charge the reasonable costs of storing and redelivering them.</li>
	<li _ngcontent-c19="">The Goods will become your responsibility from the completion of delivery or Customer collection. You must, if reasonably practicable, examine the Goods before accepting them.</li>

<h2 _ngcontent-c19="">Risk and Title</h2>

<ol _ngcontent-c19="" class="clauses">
	<li _ngcontent-c19="">Risk of damage to, or loss of, any Goods will pass to you when the Goods are delivered to you.</li>

	<li _ngcontent-c19="">The cancellation period will expire after 14 days from the day on which you acquire, or a third party, other than the carrier indicated by you, acquires physical possession of the last of the Goods. In a contract for the supply of goods over time (ie subscriptions), the right to cancel will be 14 days after the first delivery.</li>
	<li _ngcontent-c19="">To exercise the right to cancel, you must inform us of your decision to cancel this Contract by a clear statement setting out your decision (eg a letter sent by post, fax or email).
